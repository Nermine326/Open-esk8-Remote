 * Special thanks to Acton for making a remote so bad that it motivated me to
 * reverse engineer it and make my own. It was an interesting task and I 
 * definitely learned a lot in the process. Cheers.
 * 
 * Overview:
 * This is a bare bones and speciallized NRF24L01+ driver to communicate with
 * the Acton Blink QU4TRO and take control over it.
 * 
 * Note: The NRF driver is actualy not really a driver as it only replicates all
 * instructions the microprocessor of the remote was also sending to its NRF.
 * Therefore, please take this with a grain of salt.
